Requirements

    🎯 Create a client using React. #DONE
    🎯 Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints. #DONE
    🎯 Build a React form for users to create posts. #DONE
    🎯 Create multiple pages using React Router. #DONE
    🎯 Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data. #DONE
    🎯 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server. #DONE
    🎯 Display all posts using .map(). #DONE

Stretch Requirements

    🏹 Create dynamic pages using react-router-dom. #DONE
    🏹 Use react-router-dom to create a dedicated route for the categories #?
        For example, /posts/:categoryName.
    🏹 Allow users to delete posts. #MOSTLY DONE (need to rerender posts after one gets deleted)
    🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts. #Half done (functionality there but not complete to my satisfaction, such as a list of liked posts for each user and each user only allowed to like each post once, and updating the likes counter immediately when a post is liked)
    🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts. #NOT DONE BUT I WISH I HAD TIME TO TRY IT



    🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
    I have achieved all core requirements and most strech goals.
    🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
    Use SQL queries to filter results (eg when user clicks the "likes" header it sorts the list by ascending/decending order based on how many likes each post has)
    🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    I had no time to implement the feature due to other tasks taking up a lot of time due to taking forever to figure out why the code doesn't work (especially the first Fetch post sending the user's name to the database)

Overall this project was (mostly) fun as complex SQL queries and database designing was something I enjoy as well as working on the backend routes and I wish I had more time to work on features I enjoy, as well as organising my files as due to the short time limit I was rushed and spent most of my focus on trying to get as much code done as possible and it ended up as a mess, however there are still missing features such as stylings and media queries to make the site usable on mobiles.

used manny's workshop repos for quite a few parts such as put and delete endpoints
